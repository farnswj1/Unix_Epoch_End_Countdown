# Unix Epoch End Countdown
This program will render the time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the Unix epoch expires. Once the timer reaches 0 in 2038, many systems will not be able to represent time in 32 bits.

Every 5 minutes, a song will be randomly selected and played. All songs in this program are created by Pogo.
